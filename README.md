# Survival Thing

## Your second favorite vampire survivors ripoff

This application is inspired by titles such as *Vampire Survivors* and *Soul Knight*.
It will be a game about controlling a player that is faced against endless hordes of enemies.
Your goal: upgrade your gear to survive as long as possible.

### Inspiration
The idea for this project came about when I was thinking about
some of the indie games I had played in the past. As a fan of indie
games in general, I knew I had to make something related to those games.

### Mechanics
This game will be quite rudimentary, consisting of just the player and
continuously spawning enemies in a fixed box. The player will fire projectiles
at the enemies to deplete their health and eventually kill them. However, if the
player touches an enemy (or potentially enemy projectile), they will take damage.
